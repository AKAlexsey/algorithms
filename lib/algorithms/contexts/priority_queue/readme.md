# Priority queues
This is exercise to improve skills in priority queues algorithms.
I need to solve famous 8-puzzle. 
It's main idea describes that:
There is square 3x3 field, with 9 tiles. Each one of tiles is numbered in unique numbers 0..8
Initially all numbers shuffled by all tiles. Tile with number 0 is empty field. You can swap empty field with neighbours.
Your goal is move field to standard by minimum number of swaps.

Standard field:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 0 |
